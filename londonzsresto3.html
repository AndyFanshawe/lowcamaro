<h1><font face="Arial"><b><u>Heater and AC</u></b></font></h1>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>On the 200 mile journey back from Rainham, I turned the
heater dial and it went to full hot!!</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Nothing would change it.....</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>I put a test light on the signal to the heater control
valve in the middle of the firewall (below windscreen) and it had a regular
pulsing that changed frequency depending on the temp setting (pulse width
modulated), which meant the actual valve had stuck - probably full of
antifreeze.&nbsp; Which it was.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Old one removed and new one fitted....</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Popped the car over to Halfords in Drakehouse for an AC service.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>35 mins later and the temp at the face vents is 4
degrees!&nbsp; lower than most new cars.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Later that day, there was water dripping from the
heater box onto the carpet - no doubt due to condensation from the AC.&nbsp; But
there should be a drain for that.&nbsp; And here it is...</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><b>The power wire from the stereo has been
pushed through the hole, trapping and blocking the drain tube for the AC!&nbsp;
Red wire removed and drain tube blown through and reinserted.&nbsp; Should be
okay now.</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><b>There was a blue power wire coming from
the battery down the passenger side of the car, so I connected that up to power
the cap and amp.&nbsp; </b></font></p>
